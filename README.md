The model and code is described in the following article:

Hamis, S.J., Kapelyukh, Y., McLaren, A. et al. Quantifying ERK activity in response to inhibition of the BRAFV600E-MEK-ERK cascade using mathematical modelling. Br J Cancer 125, 1552â€“1560 (2021). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41416-021-01565-w

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41416-021-01565-w

See the main manuscript for a model description.
See the supplementary material (SM2) for instructions on how to run and modify the code. 

Please cite the above article when citing the code.

Update (Aug 2023): The folder extendend_code includes two folders contributed by @ciciakai,
(1) huang_ferrell which uses the modelling framework developed in (Hamis et al., Br J Cancer 2023) to study the cascade model presented by Huang & Ferrell, PNAS 1996.
(2) three_drugs which extends the model developed in (Hamis et al., Br J Cancer 2023) to include an third drug (an ERK-inhibitor).
